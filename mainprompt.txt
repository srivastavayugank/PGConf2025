Step 1: Create a Blocking Transaction
In the first session, start a transaction and acquire an advisory lock:

SQL

BEGIN;

-- Acquire an exclusive advisory lock
SELECT pg_advisory_lock(1);

-- Simulate a long-running transaction
SELECT pg_sleep(300);  -- Sleep for 5 minutes

-- Keep the transaction open
-- COMMIT or ROLLBACK will release the lock
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Step 2: Create a Blocked Transaction
In the second session, try to acquire the same advisory lock or perform an operation that will be blocked by the first transaction:

SQL

BEGIN;

-- This will wait until the lock is released in the first session
SELECT pg_advisory_lock(1);

-- Your query
SELECT * FROM sometesttable;

-- Commit or rollback the transaction
COMMIT;
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Step 3: Observe the Blocking
You can use the pg_stat_activity view to observe the blocking:

SQL

SELECT 
    pid,
    usename,
    state,
    wait_event_type,
    wait_event,
    query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE wait_event IS NOT NULL;
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
This setup will help you create and observe blocking processes in PostgreSQL. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
